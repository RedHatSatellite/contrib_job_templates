# deploy_capsule
## Deploy a capsule on an existing machine through REx

First, run the deploy_capsule_to_satellite.erb job to create the necessary
certificates and copy them over to the capsule. The install_capsule.erb is run
automatically through Hammer if the deploy_capsule_to_satellite.erb succeeds.
