# Moving a system to a new Capsule server
## move_system_to_other_capsule

The job template move_system_to_other_capsule can help you easily migrate
existing systems to another Capsule to spread load.

The template assumes you have done the following things manually:

- first of all, you need to assign the new Capsule as content source, Puppet
  Master, Puppet CA and, potentially, Openscap Capsule. If you do not do this,
  various things will not work correctly.

  To be exact:
    - setting Content Source makes the katello-rhsm-consumer script work
      correctly setting up /etc/yum.repos.d/* and /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf
    - setting a Puppet Master / CA is especially important if you manage
      puppet.conf with puppet, for obvious reasons, but even if you do not do
      that: your system will only show up on the 'Puppet' Tab of the Capsule
      page of the new Capsule if this is set correctly
    - setting OpenSCAP Capsule will make the client send it's OpenSCAP reports
      to the right host. This parameter is used by Puppet to configure the
      foreman_scap_client.

- after the job is done, Puppet on the client will send a CSR to the Capsule.
  You have to sign that manually.

- after you run the job, you manually have to revoke the SSL client certificate
  for the systems on the old Capsule. The job template will not do that for
  you.

In short, to use this job:

- Import it into Satellite through Job Templates -> Import
- Alter the content Source, Puppet Master, Puppet CA and OpenSCAP Capsule
  settings in your client(s) to point to your new capsule
- Run the job on your client(s), providing it with the name of the new Capsule
  and, optionally, whether you want to run Puppet once with --waitforcert
  enabled, and whether you want to restart Puppet after the job is done.
- Either sign the CSR or, if you have an auto-sign rule, get some coffee
- Revoke the old cert on the old Capsule for you client(s)

To do:
  - this job template does not do error checking, nor does it roll back in case
    of error
