# Moving a system to a new Capsule server
## move_system_to_other_capsule

The job template move_system_to_other_capsule can help you easily migrate
existing systems to another Capsule to spread load.

The template assumes you have done the following things manually:

- first of all, you need to assign the new Capsule as content source, Puppet
  Master, Puppet CA and, potentially, Openscap Capsule. If you do not do this,
  various things will not work correctly.

  To be exact:
    - setting Content Source makes the katello-rhsm-consumer script work
      correctly setting up /etc/yum.repos.d/* and /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf
    - setting a Puppet Master / CA is especially important if you manage
      puppet.conf with puppet, for obvious reasons, but even if you do not do
      that: your system will only show up on the 'Puppet' Tab of the Capsule
      page of the new Capsule if this is set correctly
    - setting OpenSCAP Capsule will make the client send it's OpenSCAP reports
      to the right host. This parameter is used by Puppet to configure the
      foreman_scap_client.

- after you run the job, you manually have to revoke the SSL client certificate
  for the systems on the old Capsule. The job template will not do that for
  you.
